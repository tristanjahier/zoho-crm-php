## [Unreleased]

https://github.com/tristanjahier/zoho-crm-php/compare/0.5.0...master

### Added

- Client preference `keep_raw_responses` (default `true`) to toggle retention of raw HTTP responses in response objects.
- Interface `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\ClientPreferenceContainerInterface`.
- Method `preferences` to interface `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\ClientInterface`.
- Method `isDisabled` to `Zoho\Crm\PreferenceContainer`.
- Methods `cancelBeforeEachRequestCallback` and `cancelAfterEachRequestCallback` to interface `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\ClientInterface` to deregister callbacks by ID.

### Changed

- Dropped support for PHP 7.
- Dropped support for Doctrine Inflector 1.
- `Zoho\Crm\V2\ResponseParser` will now throw an `UnreadableResponseException` when the API response body cannot be parsed.
- All exceptions provided by the library now extend `Zoho\Crm\Exceptions\Exception`.
- Denominations of "queries" have been changed for "requests" everywhere in the code. "Queries" was a confusing name. Indeed these objects act as high-level abstractions for API HTTP requests, so this name is more suitable. Very notable changes:
  - Interfaces `QueryInterface` and `PaginatedQueryInterface` were replaced with `RequestInterface` and `PaginatedRequestInterface`.
  - Methods of interface `ClientInterface` have been renamed: `executeQuery => executeRequest`, `executeAsyncBatch => executeAsyncRequestBatch`, `beforeQueryExecution => beforeEachRequest` and `afterQueryExecution => afterEachRequest`.
  - `Zoho\Crm\QueryProcessor` was renamed `Zoho\Crm\RequestProcessor`.
  - The `Query` suffix was changed for `Request` in all API query objects. For example: `ListQuery => ListRequest`, `SearchQuery => SearchRequest` `UpdateQuery => UpdateRequest`.
- In `HttpRequestableInterface`, method `getUrl` has been replaced by `getUrlPath`, because it simplifies implementations to require the URL path separately.
- Renamed "request sender" to "HTTP layer" to clarify that this component is purely dedicated to HTTP transport (interface `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\HttpLayerInterface` and implementation `Zoho\Crm\HttpLayer`).
  - The HTTP layer also has the new responsibility to create HTTP request objects with the `createRequest` method.
  - Additionally, method `send` was renamed `sendRequest` and method `sendAsync` was renamed `sendAsyncRequest` to match the PSR-18 client interface. Signatures of methods `sendAsyncRequest` and `fetchAsyncResponses` were modified.
  - The default implementation of the HTTP layer allows dependency injection of the preferred PSR-18 HTTP client and PSR-17 request & stream factories.
- Added explicit dependency on `psr/http-message`. To be clear: the library was *already* dependent on this package, but it was mistakenly relying on Guzzle to install it.
- The full original HTTP responses will now be kept in response objects, instead of only the raw body contents. In interface `ResponseInterface`, the `getRawContent` method has been replaced with `getRawResponses`, which must always return an array of HTTP responses.
  - Consequently, request method `getRaw` was changed to return an array of HTTP responses (PSR interface) if the request is paginated, or else a single HTTP response.
- API access token refreshing is now handled by a dedicated component named the "access token broker", which must implement `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\AccessTokenBrokerInterface`. Related changes:
  - `Zoho\Crm\V2\Client`'s constructor now accepts an instance of `AccessTokenBrokerInterface` as its first argument, replacing the client ID, client secret and refresh token. Default implementation is `Zoho\Crm\V2\AccessTokenBroker`.
  - The callbacks registered with `Zoho\Crm\V2\Client::accessTokenRefreshed` now receive 2 arguments: the new access token (`string`) and its expiry date (`DateTimeInterface`), instead of an `array`.
  - `Zoho\Crm\V2\Client::refreshAccessToken` return type is now `void`.
  - Methods `setAuthorizationEndpoint` and `getAuthorizationEndpoint` in `Zoho\Crm\V2\Client` have been removed.
- Moved `Zoho\Crm\V2\AccessTokenStores\StoreInterface` to `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\AccessTokenStoreInterface`.
- Moved access token store implementations (`FileStore`, `NoStore` etc.) from namespace `Zoho\Crm\V2\AccessTokenStores` to `Zoho\Crm\AccessTokenStorage`.
- Enabled injection of request processing dependencies in `Zoho\Crm\V2\Client`'s constructor:
  - The 3rd argument is an optional implementation of `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\HttpLayerInterface`.
  - The 4th argument is an optional implementation of `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\ResponseParserInterface`.
  - The 5th argument is an optional implementation of `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\ErrorHandlerInterface`.
  - Injected objects can be provided with the client preferences by implementing `Zoho\Crm\ClientPreferencesAware`.
- The optional `$endpoint` argument in `Zoho\Crm\V2\Client`'s constructor is now at the 6th position.
- `Zoho\Crm\PreferencesContainer` has been renamed `Zoho\Crm\PreferenceContainer` and is now abstract and implements `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\ClientPreferenceContainerInterface`.
- Methods `beforeEachRequest` and `afterEachRequest` (formerly `beforeQueryExecution` and `afterQueryExecution`) of interface `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\ClientInterface` have 2 extra optional arguments:
  - `string $id`: to uniquely identify the registered callback.
  - `bool $overwrite`: to overwrite a potential callback that would already be registered with this ID.
- This package is not dependent on Guzzle anymore. It instead relies on any implementations of the interfaces defined by PSR-7, PSR-17 and PSR-18. In addition it optionally relies on some HTTPlug interfaces for the support of asynchronous requests. Guzzle is now only a development dependency (and could be replaced by anything else compatible).
- Modified the way that request pagination works. The request paginator component has been trimmed a lot. Its responsibilities have been simplified. Now it must provide a request object for the next page, analyse a given API response, and determine if there is more data to fetch. All the logic of page iteration, sending requests and collecting API responses is now done by the request processor. This change has been made to avoid a cyclic dependency between the request processor and request paginators. Most notably:
  - In `RequestPaginatorInterface`, methods `fetchAll` and `getResponses` have been removed, and methods `getNextPageRequest`, `handlePage` and `hasMoreData` were added.
  - `Zoho\Crm\AbstractRequestPaginator` and `Zoho\Crm\V2\RequestPaginator` have been deleted, and `Zoho\Crm\RequestPaginator` was added.
- Type declarations (a.k.a. type hints) have been added or updated everywhere possible. It can be a breaking change if you were implementing interfaces or extending classes. These changes will **not** be detailed in this change log.
- Updated docblocks. This has no impact on the library's functionnality. It is only mentioned because it could help your IDE make better suggestions and hints when working with this library.

### Removed

- Support for version 1 of the API. The whole `Zoho\Crm\V1` namespace has been deleted.
- Unused classes `Zoho\Crm\ResponseFormat` and `Zoho\Crm\IdList`.
- Trait `Zoho\Crm\Support\ClassShortNameTrait`. Replaced by `Zoho\Crm\Support\Helper::getClassShortName`.
- Unused exception classes:
  - `Zoho\Crm\Exceptions`
    - `Api`
      - `AbstractException`
      - `GenericException`
      - `InvalidParametersException`
      - `InvalidTicketIdException`
      - `RateLimitExceededException`
      - `RecordNotFoundException`
      - `RequestLimitExceededException`
    - `InvalidModuleException`
    - `MethodNotFoundException`
    - `ModuleNotFoundException`
    - `UnsupportedModuleException`

### Fixed

- Deprecation warnings related to functions `explode`, `trim` and `preg_match`.

### Development

- Upgraded dependencies:
  - `symfony/var-dumper`: `5 -> 6`
- Required PsySH (`psy/psysh`) as a development dependency (instead of relying only on a global installation).
- Installed PHP Coding Standards Fixer (`friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer`) as a development dependency.
- Added configuration files for 2 documentation generators: [phpDocumentor](https://phpdoc.org/) and [Doctum](https://doctum.long-term.support/).
- Installed PHPStan (`phpstan/phpstan`) as a development dependency, and made the codebase comply up to level 2.


## [0.5.0] - 2023-09-03

### Added

- Support for version 2 of the API. Components specific to this version are under the `Zoho\Crm\V2` namespace. Notably, the client class is `Zoho\Crm\V2\Client`.
  - The API support is divided into "sub-APIs", which are helpers that regroup multiple related features of the API. They are attached to the client and you can access them as public properties (e.g.: `$client->theSubApi`). Currently available sub-APIs are `records` and `users`. See [README.md](/README.md) for further documentation.
  - The client needs an "access token store" object to handle its API access token persistency. There are multiple basic implementations available in namespace `Zoho\Crm\V2\AccessTokenStores`. It must implement `StoreInterface`.
- Compatibility with Guzzle 7.
- Compatibility with PHP 8.
- Compatibility with Doctrine Inflector 2.
- `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\ErrorHandlerInterface`.
- `createFromString` static method to `Zoho\Crm\Support\UrlParameters`.
- `getRaw` method to all queries (v1 and v2), to get the raw contents of the API response.
- `Zoho\Crm\V2\Scopes` utility class.
- `Zoho\Crm\Utils\OAuthHelper` utility class.
- `Zoho\Crm\PreferencesContainer` base class for client preferences. It adds a new `isSet` method to check if a preference value is not `null`.

### Changed

- Composer package has been renamed `tristanjahier/zoho-crm`.
- Everything specific to version 1 of the API has been moved under the dedicated `Zoho\Crm\V1` namespace. Notably, the client class is now `Zoho\Crm\V1\Client`.
- Dependency injection in `Zoho\Crm\QueryProcessor` is now mandatory. Arguments `$requestSender` and `$responseParser` are not optional anymore, and `$errorHandler` has been added.
- `Zoho\Crm\RequestSender` constructor does not accept a `$preferences` argument anymore.
- Denominations of "HTTP verb" have been changed for "HTTP method" everywhere in the code. Because of that, the `getHttpVerb` method of `Zoho\Crm\Contracts\RequestableInterface` has been renamed `getHttpMethod`, and the `Zoho\Crm\Support\HttpVerb` class has been renamed `Zoho\Crm\Support\HttpMethod`.
- Method `setHttpMethod` of queries now throws an exception (`Zoho\Crm\Exceptions\InvalidHttpMethodException`) when an invalid value is provided.
- Denominations of "URI" have been changed for "URL" everywhere in the code. More information below.
- In `RequestableInterface`, method `setUri` has been removed. Other methods have been renamed: `getUri => getUrl`, `setUriParameter => setUrlParameter`. New methods have been added: `getUrlParameters`, `getUrlParameter`, `hasUrlParameter`, `removeUrlParameter`. Query implementations have been changed accordingly. Notably:
  - Multiple methods of `Zoho\Crm\V1\Query` have been renamed: `setUriParameter => setUrlParameter`, `getParameters => getUrlParameters`, `getParameter => getUrlParameter`, `hasParameter => hasUrlParameter`. `resetParameters` has also been renamed to `resetUrlParameters` for consistency.
- In `PaginatedQueryInterface`, method `paginated` has been removed, method `isPaginated` has been renamed `mustBePaginatedAutomatically`, and 2 other methods were added: `mustBePaginatedConcurrently` and `getConcurrency`. Query implementations have been changed accordingly. Furthermore:
  - Method `paginated`, used to turn on and off the automatic pagination of queries, has been renamed `autoPaginated`.
  - Method `mustFetchPagesAsynchronously`, used to determine if pages must be fetched concurrently, has been renamed `mustBePaginatedConcurrently`.
- In `QueryInterface`, method `getClient` was added.
- `Zoho\Crm\Support\UrlParameters` now supports string-casting for all implementations of `DateTimeInterface`, instead of just instances of `DateTime`.
- `Zoho\Crm\Exceptions\InvalidQueryException` now shows the HTTP method in its message.
- `Zoho\Crm\Support\Collection` now implements `Zoho\Crm\Support\Arrayable`.

### Fixed

- Client ID, client secret and refresh token are now sent to the authorization endpoint in the request body instead of the URL query string. This is considered a fix because it improves security by reducing the risk of exposing these secrets in clear in error messages.

### Deprecated

- Installing from old Composer package name `tristanjahier/zoho-crm-php`.

### Development

- Upgraded dependencies:
  - `phpunit/phpunit`: `5 -> 9`
  - `symfony/var-dumper`: `4 -> 5`


## [0.4.0] - 2020-09-26

### Added

- Documentation comments everywhere in the code (classes, properties, methods...).
- Documentation/developer guide in README.md to teach all the basics to use this library. The guide is not an exhaustive technical documentation but should cover a vast majority of the use cases.
- Support for 12 new modules: Accounts, Campaigns, Cases, ContactRoles, Deals, Invoices, PriceBooks, PurchaseOrders, Quotes, SalesOrders, Solutions, Vendors.
- `triggerWorkflowRules`, `unselect`, `selectAll`, `selectTimestamps`, `selectDefaultColumns` methods to `Zoho\Crm\Api\Query`.
- `apiModules()` method to `Info` module class.
- New methods to `Zoho\Crm\Support\Collection`: `sum`, `collapse`, `flatMap`, `except`, `intersect`, `random`.
- New methods to `Zoho\Crm\Entities\Collection`: `uniqueById`.
- `Zoho\Crm\Entities\Records\Record` as a base class for all record entities (e.g. `Call`, `Contact`, `Lead`, `Product` etc.).
- `Zoho\Crm\Entities\ImmutableEntity`.
- `relationsOf()` method to all module classes.
- `stageHistoryOf()` and `contactRolesOf()` to `Deals` module class.
- "Before query execution" and "after query execution" hooks.
- Support for concurrent queries.
- Client preferences:
  - `concurrent_pagination_by_default` (default `false`) to enable concurrency by default for all paginated queries.
  - `default_concurrency` (default `5`) the number of concurrent API requests by default.
- Interfaces (also referred to as "contracts") in `Zoho\Crm\Contracts` namespace: `ClientInterface`, `QueryInterface`, `PaginatedQueryInterface`, `ResponseInterface`, `MiddlewareInterface`, `RequestableInterface`, `QueryPaginatorInterface`, `ResponsePageMergerInterface`, `ResponseTransformerInterface`, `RequestSenderInterface`, `ResponseParserInterface`. These interfaces define the most important interconnected components of the API client, and are part of the foundations for more flexibility, customization and testability of the library.
- Query middleware. Registered via the client, applied to all executing queries.
- `Zoho\Crm\Api\UrlParameters::createFromUrl()`.
- `getUrlPathSegments()` and `getUrlPathSegmentByIndex()` methods to `Zoho\Crm\Support\Helper`.
- `Zoho\Crm\Api\RawQuery` query class, allowing developers to define any API request manually.
- `Zoho\Crm\Client::newRawQuery()`.

### Changed

- Dropped support for PHP < 7.3.
- Renamed `Client::DEFAULT_FORMAT` into `Client::DEFAULT_RESPONSE_FORMAT`.
- Changed entities string-cast result. It now returns a prettified JSON with the entity type and its properties.
- `'getDeletedRecordIds'` API method returns an empty array when the response is empty, instead of `null`.
- Letter case of all variables and properties has been changed from _snake_case_ to _camelCase_.
- Renamed entity "properties" into "attributes". It does not affect the use of entity objects, except for casting to string (`__toString()`) and serialization (`__sleep()`).
- The primary key is not defined in the modules anymore, it is defined at the entity level. For this purpose:
  - the `$primaryKey` static property and `primaryKey()` static method were removed from modules,
  - an `$idName` static property and an `idName()` static method have been added to entities,
  - entities' method `key()` was replaced with `getId()`,
  - entity collections' method `entityKeys()` with `entityIds()`.
- Renamed `PotStageHistory` entity into `PotentialStageHistoryEntry`.
- Moved the "query processing" code from the `Zoho\Crm\Client` class to a dedicated `Zoho\Crm\QueryProcessor` class which acts as an engine. This engine has 2 components to handle the different steps of query execution:
  - `Zoho\Crm\RequestSender` sends the HTTP requests and returns the raw response of the API.
  - `Zoho\Crm\ResponseParser` parses the raw API response then transforms it to make it easier to read and use (replaces static helper `Zoho\Crm\Api\ResponseParser`).
  - Both of these components can be manually injected in the query processor via its constructor, as long as they implement their respective interfaces, `RequestSenderInterface` and `ResponseParserInterface`.
- Made API method handlers used as instances attached to the `Client` instead of static helpers.
  - Interface `Zoho\Crm\Api\Methods\MethodInterface` received a lot of changes:
    - methods `responseContainsData()` and `expectsMultipleRecords()` were removed,
    - method `tidyResponse()` was renamed into `cleanResponse()`,
    - methods `getHttpVerb()`, `isResponseEmpty()`, `getEmptyResponse()` and `convertResponse()` were added,
    - all methods are now instance methods (not static anymore).
  - Base method handler `Zoho\Crm\Api\Methods\AbstractMethod`:
    - method `getResponseDataType()` was removed.
  - `Client::registerMethodHandler()` now requires any implementation of `MethodInterface` (instead of a class extending `AbstractMethod` before).
- The response-parsing logic was completely revamped. The content of the API response is now parsed and transformed inside `Zoho\Crm\ResponseParser` and the resulting `Response` object will not be modified afterwards. To achieve that, a lot of changes were made:
    - all content post-processing (e.g. conversion into entity objects or collections) was moved to API method handlers. This was formerly done by the method `getQueryResults()` of `Client`, which was removed.
    - paginated responses merger is now handled by the query processor instead of the query paginator. The merger logic is defined in the API method handlers thanks to a new interface `Zoho\Crm\Api\Methods\MethodWithPaginationInterface`.
    - the `Zoho\Crm\Api\Response` class was pruned of many methods (`getType()`, `containsRecords()`, `hasSingleRecord()`, `hasMultipleRecords()`, `isConvertibleToEntity()`, `toEntity()`, `toEntityCollection()`) and properties (`$type`, `$hasMultipleRecords`).
- Collections use `array_key_first()` and `array_key_last()` to select their ends (instead of `reset()` and `end()`).
- Replaced `AbstractEntity` with `Entity`, which is a default minimal implementation instead of an abstract.
- Responses to the `getFields` API method will now be encapsulated in `FieldSection` and `Field` entities. `Zoho\Crm\Api\Modules\ModuleFields::getAll()` returns an entity collection of `Zoho\Crm\Entities\Field`.
- Responses to the `getModules` API method will now be encapsulated in collections of `Module` entities.
- `insert()` and `update()` methods of `Zoho\Crm\Api\Modules\AbstractRecordsModule` now return single values instead of arrays.
- Methods `format`, `module`, `method` and `limit` of `Zoho\Crm\Api\Query` accept `null` to unset the related value.
- `Zoho\Crm\Api\Query::select()` is now cumulative. It does not overwrite the previous selection, it adds up to it.
- `Zoho\Crm\Api\UrlParameters::__toString()` was improved.
- Removed `Zoho\Crm\Api` namespace. All contents have been moved to the parent namespace `Zoho\Crm`. In this release change log there might still be references to this namespace.
- Moved `Zoho\Crm\HttpVerb` to `Zoho\Crm\Support\HttpVerb`, add missing verbs (`HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `CONNECT`), and add 2 helper methods: `getAll` and `isValid`.

### Fixed

- `Zoho\Crm\Support\Collection::binarySearch()`.
- `Zoho\Crm\Support\Collection::getItemPropertyValue()` for undefined array indexes.
- XML data will now correctly be sent in the request body instead of the URL query string.
- `Zoho\Crm\Api\QueryPaginator::applyQueryConstraints()`: limit of fetched records and maximum modification date.
- `Zoho\Crm\Api\Query::getSelectedColumns()`.
- `Zoho\Crm\Api\QueryPaginator::handlePageResponse()`: partially filled response pages will correctly stop the pagination.
- `Zoho\Crm\Client::newQuery()` without arguments.

### Removed

- The property aliases feature of entities.
- Class `Zoho\Crm\Api\ResponseParser`.
- Class `Zoho\Crm\Api\ResponseDataType`.
- Methods `getMethodClass()` and `getEntityClass()` and `BASE_NAMESPACE` constant from `Zoho\Crm\Support\Helper`.
- `Zoho\Crm\Api\Query::paginate()`.

### Development

- Renamed `dev_material/` directory into `dev/`. So the autoloaded development sources directory is now `dev/src/`.


## [0.3.0] - 2019-04-19

### Added

- Installation instructions in README.md.
- A generic collection class: `Zoho\Crm\Support\Collection`. It supports a lot of common array-like operations and has a powerful `where()` method to filter its content.
- An `Arrayable` interface to ensure the presence of `toArray()` method.
- Methods to ease handling boolean-type preferences: `enable()`, `disable()` and `isEnabled()`.
- "exception_messages_obfuscation" preference to hide the API auth token in request exception messages.
- `newEntity()` method to modules.
- A reference to the client and module in entities.
- `key()` method to entities and `entityKeys()` to entity collections.
- Ability to use a custom API endpoint.
- Ability to define module aliases. Useful for custom modules whose names are awful (CustomModule1...)
- Support for API error 4421 through `RequestLimitExceededException`.
- `primaryKey()` method to `Users` module.
- Entities serialization.

### Changed

- Dropped support for PHP 5.5. Minimum requirement is now PHP 7.1.
- Renamed namespace `Zoho\CRM` into `Zoho\Crm`.
- Renamed `Exception` namespaces into `Exceptions`.
- Replaced `Request` class with `Query` class, which is more flexible and provides method-chaining possibilities. Also replaced `RequestPaginator` with `QueryPaginator`.
- More generally, completely redesigned the request pipeline.
- Removed class `RequestLauncher`, moved the request counter to `Client`.
- Removed `ModuleFields` instance (e.g. `$zoho->contacts->fields`) from modules that do not support the `getFields` API method.
- Removed `functions.php` and replaced them with a static class helper: `Zoho\Crm\Support\Helper`.
- Made entities `Collection`, `IdList`, `UrlParameters` and `Preferences` extend the new generic collection `Zoho\Crm\Support\Collection`.
- Removed all formerly existing client preferences. All queries are now strictly validated, paginated queries are now automatically fetched when needed, and the records are now always returned as entity objects when possible.
- Most of the modules methods now return a `Query` object (instead of executing a request), so that the developer can chain his own constraints before actually making a call to the API.
- Most of the modules methods have been renamed.
- Allowed to create a query by calling the name of an API method directly on a module instance. e.g. `$zoho->potentials->getRecords()`.
- Entities `toArray()` method now return the real Zoho property names instead of aliases. Use `toAliasArray()` to get the former result.
- Improved how modules are attached to the client and handled internally.

### Fixed

- A bug when trying to determine if we reached the maximum modification date while fetching pages in `QueryPaginator` (formerly `RequestPaginator`).
- URL parameters are now properly encoded.
- Parsing for a rare (but odd!) API response for module Events when there is no data.

### Development

- Autoload `dev_material/src` directory in development environment.
- Added custom casters for symfony/var-dumper and PsySH local config file (`.psysh.php`) to load them automatically.


## [0.2.0] - 2018-07-30

### Added

- Support for these modules: Events, Tasks, Notes and Attachments.
- Support for these API methods: `getSearchRecordsByPDC` and `deleteFile`.
- Support for 3 new comparison operators to entity collections: `'in'`, `'=~'` (regex) and `'like'`.
- `fetchLimit()` to `RequestPaginator`, to fetch a given number of pages.
- "validate_requests" preference.
- A request counter to `RequestLauncher`.

### Fixed

- A bug with `getRecords` response parsing.


## [0.1.0] - 2018-05-16

Initial development release.
TODO: describe briefly what this first version provided.
